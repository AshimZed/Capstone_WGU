## Application Files
The application requires four primary files for operation. These files are prepared for delivery to the client and are also available on GitHub for easy access and version control.

### The essential files are:

- __Fight_Interest.ipynb:__ The Jupyter Notebook file with the executable code and interactive model.
- __moderate_divisions_dataset.csv:__ The dataset used by the application for its computations and visualizations.
- __requirements.txt:__ A list of Python packages that are necessary to run the notebook effectively.

## Userâ€™s Guide
To use the application, please follow these steps:

> - Visit mybinder.org. 
> - In the field labeled 'GitHub repository name or URL' input "https://github.com/AshimZed/Capstone_WGU". 
> - Click the 'launch' button. Wait for the new page to load, which will instantiate a Jupyter environment. 
> - Upon loading, you'll see the Jupyter logo at the top left and a file browser listing all the available files. 
> - Open Fight_Interest.ipynb by clicking on it. This action will load the Jupyter notebook containing the application's source code. 
> - Once the notebook is open, locate the 'Run' button on the toolbar. 
> - Click the 'Run' button to execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially. Alternatively, you can use 'Cell' > 'Run All' from the menu to execute all cells at once. 
> - After running all cells, scroll to the bottom of the notebook to access the interactive model.

With these steps, you will activate the notebook's interactive features, enabling you to engage with the data through tables, charts, and visualizations. The interactive model at the end of the notebook will allow for real-time data manipulation and observation of results.
